# PyTorch-YOLOv3
A minimal PyTorch implementation of YOLOv3, with support for training, inference and evaluation. This file is a reversion of yolov3 and most of the py files are coming from another github author. I test and try to refrain the work. If you want to know more, please go to following github site. https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3.git.
